The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

For this assignment, several steps were completed to set up the database to proform the necessary analysis in the 2nd part of this assignment.

To begin we imported the data via code in terminal, then from there set up the database in the Jupyter notebook.
